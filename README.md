# Tumor-Diagnosis
**Description:**
Using the exploratory data analysis (EDA) results from the Breast Cancer Diagnosis â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis Guided Project, I practiced dropping correlated features, implementing feature selection, and utilizing several feature extraction methods including; feature selection with correlation, univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, principal component analysis (PCA) and tree-based feature selection methods. 

**In this project I:**
1) Imported Libraries and Data
2) Dropped Correlated Columns from Feature List
3) Did classification using XGBoost (minimal feature selection)
4) Did Univariate Feature Selection
5) Applied Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation
6) Plotted CV Scores vs Number of Features Selected
7) Did Feature Extraction using Principal Component Analysis

**Language used:**

Python

**Files:**
1) **Tumor Diagnosis.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook containing my work.
2) **data.csv"** is the data used.
